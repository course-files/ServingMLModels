**1. Issue Title**

-   A good title should include the key components of the issue, such as the error code, the affected system, and the action causing it.
    -   Example: "Error 500: Internal Server Error when deploying Flask app to Heroku"

**2. Provide Context**

    -   *Example:* "I was trying to deploy a Python Flask application to Heroku using the Heroku CLI."
-   Where is the issue occurring? Specify the environment or platform (e.g., operating system and software version).
    -   *Example:* "The issue is occurring on Ubuntu 22.04 with Python 3.10."

**3. Error Message**

-   Copy and paste the exact error message and screenshot it. Avoid paraphrasing the error message.
    -   *Example:* ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'flask_sqlalchemy' Use formatting tools to improve readability, e.g., enclosing the message using 3 back-tick symbols \*\*\`\`\`\*- to form a code block

**4. Setup Details**

-   List steps or solutions you have already attempted, including their outcomes.
    -   *Example:* "I installed `flask_sqlalchemy` using `pip install flask_sqlalchemy`, but the error persists after restarting the server."
-   The aim is to avoid making others suggest solutions you have already ruled out.

**6. Supporting Information**

-   Logs: Include relevant sections of logs, using a code block to preserve formatting.
-   Code snippets: Share relevant portions of code. \*\*Make sure the code is minimal\*- and replicates the issue.
-   Configurations: Share configuration files or settings related to the problem.
-   Screenshots: Use sparingly, only when visuals are more informative than text.

**7. Specific Questions**

-   Clearly state what you want help with:
    -   *Example:* "How can I resolve this module error?"
    -   *Example:* "What steps can I take to debug a 500 error on Heroku?"

Lastly, please be concise and polite 😊
